        <strong>Three-hit Combination Blowback<br/>(A)(A)(A)~(A)</strong>
        <p>A string of attacks: a strike with the left elbow before Kyo does a right low kick, then twists right around to do a left sobat kick before rearing back and performing a heavy shoulder slam to, as the name suggests, 'blow back' his opponent. The combo brings him slightly forward upon execution, and the final part of it can be charged for a delay and has priority over other normals.</p>
        <strong>Uppercut<br/>↑ (A)</strong>
        <p>Quite literally an uppercut in which Kyo quickly drops to a knee before bringing his fist flying straight up when he rises again.</p>
        <strong>Crouching Low Kick<br/>↓ (A)</strong>
        <p>A simple kick made when Kyo is crouching. Recovers fast enough for him to combo into any normal or Smash attack.</p>
        <strong>Geshiki: Gofu Yo<br/>↔ (A)</strong>
        <p>A simple axe kick that brings his body weight forward to give more 'kick'(lol) to the blow.</p>
        <strong>R.E.D Kick<br/>‹‹↔›› (A)</strong>
        <p>Kyo leaps across a considerable distance with a combustion-fueled propulsion that sends him into an arcing kick. A precision move that can be used to leap right over a projectile or thrown item to attack the pitcher directly.</p>
        <strong>Jumping Light Kick<br/>* (A)</strong>
        <p>An aerial knee that knocks the opponent downward when hit.</p>
        <strong>Jumping Heavy Kick<br/>*↑ (A)</strong>
        <p>Kyo does a mid-air spin into an aerial axe kick. Can hit enemy above him as well as enemy below him, making it functionally a two-hit attack.</p>
        <strong>Jumping Heavy Punch<br/>*↔ (A)</strong>
        <p>Functions much like the aerial knee with the exception of knocking the enemy more diagonally.</p>
        <strong>Naraku Otoshi<br/>*↓ (A)</strong>
        <p>A powerful airbound hammerfist that smashes the enemy straight downward. Outright comparable to Captain Falcon's lower body variation.</p>
        <strong>101 Shiki: Oboroguruma<br/>! (A)</strong>
        <p>Kyo propels himself forward with a combustion propulsion into a triple flying kick.</p>
        <strong>75 Shiki: Kai<br/>!↑ (A)</strong>
        <p>A jumping, rising double kick. This move also brings him slightly forward.</p>
        <strong>88 Shiki<br/>!↓ (A)</strong>
        <p>Kyo drops to his left hand and brings his feet swinging low for a double kick. The move only smashes if both hits connect.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="movelist" id="z">
        <strong>212 Shiki: Kototsuki Yo<br/>┴ [&nbsp;Z&nbsp;]</strong>
        <p>Kyo will lift his opponent by their very neck or head and blow them away with a flaming explosion that continues to burn their being for a few seconds afterward.</p>
        <strong>Issetsu Seoi Nage<br/>↓ [&nbsp;Z&nbsp;]</strong>
        <p>Kyo throws his enemy over his shoulder and straight into the ground before following up immediately with an elbow drop to their neck or head.</p>
        <strong>Knee Smash<br/>[&nbsp;Z&nbsp;]</strong>
        <p>Kyo just keeps smashing his knee into his opponent's gut.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="movelist" id="b">
        <strong>108 Shiki: Yamibarai<br/>(B)</strong>
        <p>Kyo flicks out a fast-moving fireball right across the ground. Though it is easy to simply jump over, its grounded state allows it to run right past projectiles or thrown items and hit the user directly. When cast in the air it travels diagonally from where Kyo is, and unlike Orochinagi it does not force him back from 'recoil'.</p>
        <strong>Saishuu Kessen Ougi "Mu Shiki"<br/>↔ (B)</strong>
        <p>Essentially a stronger but slower fist version of Marth/Lucina's Dancing Blade with only three hits to it. Each hit adds another tick of 'burn' to the opponent thus making it functionally a six-hit attack. The final hits of the combo special will knock the opponent towards the final directional input: up sends them directly upward, forward sends them flying forward, down sends them crashing into the ground to stun them long enough to follow up with another attack.</p>
        <strong>100 Shiki: Oniyagi<br/>↑ (B)</strong>
        <p>Kyo twists around and smashes the back of his fist into an opponent before bringing them up with him in a spiral of fire before effectively blasting them away with the updrafts from his flames. The opponent can still be burned by the fire but it is very mild in comparison to his other specials along with lacking the smashing power of the others. Its greatest use is its horizontal recovery due to the flames affecting the direction of wind.</p>
        <strong>Ura 180 Shiki: Orochinagi<br/>↓ (B)</strong>
        <p>Kyo lets loose the normal innate compression of his fire as a full sheet of offensive and defensive inferno before him; the aerial version pushes him back a bit, giving him just a bit more air time. Unlike his other specials it has a noticeable pause at it's fastest, and continuing on with its uniqueness he can charge it to make it more damaging - however, the more it is charged the faster it dissipates.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="movelist" id="ex">
        <em>Every special has an EX Variant that has an instant execution time and is three times faster and stronger than the normal version. Each EX requires at least one fully stocked bar of Meter; Kyo has three maximum. Meter is gained by attacking, gaining damage, or using items. Being KO'd or self-destructing automatically fills a bar for revival. The normal motions for the specials must be performed in order to use EX moves.</em>
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/NPGVKTH.png" alt="">
        <strong>108 Shiki: Yamibarai</strong>
        <p>The EX Variant travels near-instantly along the ground and leaves behind a trail of fire that persists for several seconds after it is used. Kyo himself is immune to these flames. The aerial version is a straight diagonal shot that explodes on impact. The fireball in both versions sets the opponent ablaze for a few seconds.</p>
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/hjCiAJA.png" alt="">
        <strong>Saishuu Kessen Ougi "Mu Shiki"</strong>
        <p>The EX Variant has Kyo outright exploding into fire and attacking viciously with every single variation of the attack at crazy speed; a pillar of fire has a soft 'vacuum' effect on the opponent to keep them from escaping the barrage of punches. The final blow sends them flying with 100%-level regardless of damage.</p>
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/JJYgqCX.png" alt="">
        <strong>100 Shiki: Oniyagi</strong>
        <p>The EX Variant is a significant upgrade in that there are two chances to hit with it fully: at the beginning and at the zenith. The flames have a slight vacuum effect much like the fire pillar in "Mu Shiki", and upon connecting at the zenith of the Oniyagi Kyo unleashes a three-hit S.K.O. "M.U" before knocking them straight forward and away. Connecting this zenith attack allows Kyo to cast the move a second time, including the EX Variant if he has the proper amount of meter.</p>
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/qTUvwsc.png" alt=""><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OB3i9ZC.png" alt="">
        <strong>Ura 180 Shiki: Orochinagi</strong>
        <p>The EX Variant is instantly cast and at full strength, as well as persisting longer than it does at its weakest. It also fully revolves around him as a more defensive ability along with incinerating those that continue to molest him.</p>

          <h2>裏１１１しき<br/>天叢雲</h2>
          <img src="http://orig09.deviantart.net/c494/f/2015/364/7/9/kyo_kusanagi_xiii_neomax___gif_animation_by_kyoflameashhylden-d9jukq4.gif" alt="">
          <p>Kyo casually lifts his left hand up and throws a small flame forward - upon connecting, a massive roar of inferno screams forward from behind him to completely engulf the opponent and the part of the stage he’s on (in the air it just goes straight a certain distance). Enemies that are hit at any point in the inferno is continuously sent along with what bursts of fire remain to be cast until hitting the end of the portion of stage (last explosion while cast mid-air). Causes a full 100% damage on contact; being hit by the last gout of fire KOs the opponent.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="movelist" id="SDM">
        <h2>最終決戦ひーおうぎ</h2>
        <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kylailutks">- T O T S U K A -</a></h2>
          <p>Kyo depletes all three gauges into a single punch. He then launches himself forward to smash his fist into the opponent. Upon connecting the entire screen is engulfed in a massive blooming inferno that heavily damages all opponents and destroys all destructible objects and items on the stage. The one hit with the punch is completely KO’d regardless of where on the stage they are; their body is left in a knockdown state before disappearing.</p>
