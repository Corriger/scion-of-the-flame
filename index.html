        <li>
          <strong>Personality</strong>
          <p>Kyo is an overconfident but well-meaning young man, more interested in enjoying life than having to partake in any particular responsibilities. He is quick to dismiss subjects that don't interest him and will often carry out his actions with
            a devil-may-care attitude. Despite his seemingly arrogant and rude demeanor, he treasures his friends and family, enjoying their presence greatly. His extreme disinterest in studies has led to his chronic inability to graduate from high school.
            Kyo takes his clan's responsibilities on a more personal level, disregarding ancient legends and predestined events as any reason for his actions. His strong sense of justice and his zeal to fight stronger opponents are what he believes to
            drive him to carry out his destiny.</p>
        </li>
        <!-- routine -->
        <li>
          <strong>Routine</strong>
          <p>Kyo lives in Japan, and whenever he’s not participating in the King of Fighters tournament he often spends his time either handling his clan duties or slacking off on his schoolwork - or just plain not attending and wandering around finding
            better things to do. That’s not to say he is dim-witted - he actually has a rather sharp mind, and simply dislikes dealing with what he sees to be unnecessary work. When he’s not trapped in school he’s off riding his bike or playing ice hockey
            - in spite of being a pyrokinetic, he’s pretty good at it. He also enjoys writing poetry, and happens to be very proud of it - however, most regard his works to be rather... bad. Kyo thinks they’re just crazy.</p>

          <strong>Sacred Treasures</strong>
          <p>When humankind had yet to scratch the surface of their potential, there existed a guardian deity of mother Gaia - Yamata no Orochi, the eight-headed serpent deity. As Her Will, Orochi was born from the earth, manifested through the floating
            emotions of the denizens of the lands and substances of nature. Granted with many of Her powers, Orochi gained many followers amongst humankind, eventually forming a group of followers - the eight strongest of whom were known as the Hakkesshu.</p>
          <p> Over time, as humankind began to grow in numbers and sought to learn more of the realm within which they lived, the natural balance of the world began to crumble - and it was at this time that Orochi’s tolerance for Her desecration dissipated,
            and he sought the complete annihilation of all humankind. Nearly two millennia ago, using Her powers purely as a means for chaos, Orochi and his clan set upon the world of humans and waged war with them, the struggle going on for a great many
            centuries - however, it was through the combined efforts of three human clans that Orochi was defeated, sealed deep within the earth with three mythical treasures.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>False Prophet</strong>
          <p>Kyo is a descendant of one of these clans, as was his father before him and those before his father. At the age of 15, he surpassed his father in both pyrokinetic ability and fighting prowess, and became his clan’s new leader. Some few years
            later, after the completion of his training, Kyo competed in a preliminary held in Japan to determine the members of the country's representative team in the upcoming King of Fighters tournament. He defeated both of the members that would
            become a part of his team, and became the team’s leader - as well as eventually befriending the two. Reaching the finals, they met and fought Rugal Bernstein, a powerful fighter that boasted his desire to fight equally powerful opponents.
            After his defeat, he blew up his ship in attempt to bring the Japan team with him - but the team escaped unharmed.</p>
          <p>Kyo and his team are invited to another King of Fighters tournament, organized once again by Rugal whom survived his craft's self-destruction. This time, Rugal also brainwashed Kyo's missing father, Saisyu, into attacking his son. Kyo's father
            regained his senses after he was subdued by the team, and to counter the team's strength Rugal challenged them with power sapped from Orochi. However, Rugal's body was overwhelmed by the power's immensity and he was disintegrated after trying
            to tap too much into it power. Pleased with his son's prowess, Saisyu leaves unnoticed, entrusting the clan's duty to Kyo.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heavenly Kings</strong>
          <p>Prior to the events of the third tournament, a man named Goenitz challenges Kyo to a fight. Kyo accepts, powered by his overwhelming confidence in his fists, only to be defeated soundly by his challenger and sent to the hospital. In spite of
            his injuries, his anger and spirit from his loss drove him to invent powerful new techniques, and he enters the year's tournament to prove his strength to his unknown attacker. In the tournament's finals, he meets the host of the tournament
            and the younger heiress of the Yata clan, Chizuru Kagura. At the tournament's end, he vanquishes Goenitz with the aid of Chizuru and Iori - the third descendant of the clans that had sealed Orochi, and Kyo’s rival. Though he is warned by Chizuru
            of his clan's destiny with Orochi, Kyo ignores her and promptly departs.</p>
          <p>Yet another tournament is announced, and Kyo enters once more. Prior to this tournament, Kyo had been experiencing nightmares about him being defeated by a strange man - nonetheless, he participates. He advanced into the finals alongside Chizuru
            and Iori once again, where they confronted the remaining "Four Heavenly Kings" - Yashiro, Shermie, and Chris. When they are beaten, Orochi possessed Chris' body and attempted to destroy the three clans at once. As was done in the legends of
            their clans, the trio successfully defeat him. In a last-ditch effort, Orochi caused one of them to enter the berserk Riot of Blood state, expecting him to turn on Kyo and the other. Instead, Iori snared Orochi, and Kyo obliged his rival by
            crippling the deity with one last deathblow, allowing Orochi to be sealed once again.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Playing With Fire</strong>
          <p>Since then, Kyo has been the target of several bodies seeking to use his power to meet their own ends. Immediately following the defeat of Orochi, Kyo was apprehended by the mysterious NESTS syndicate, whom extracted samples of his DNA which
            was then used to make an army of Kyo clones and equally powerful pyrokinetic agents. Waking up one day to find himself surrounded by bizzare needles and surgical equipment, Kyo decided to get some answers and broke out of captivity.</p>
          <p>In spite of the sedatives that ran through his bloodstream, he managed to escape his confinement - during his escape, he heard constant references to the NESTS cartel, though could gain no further information from his captors. The following
            year he tried his hand at a private investigation, though his efforts were just as fruitless as before - the most he gained was a sudden encounter with Iori, whom fought him to an unknown outcome. With nothing else he could do about the NESTS
            cartel, Kyo simply joined the tournament held in 2001, reuniting with his old teammates and Shingo, a fan of Kyo's from school.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sneering Blaze</strong>
          <p>The next passes at him came in the form of Ash Crimson, a peculiarly feminine male that sought out the powers of the three clans for unknown reasons. Approached by Chizuru to form a team with herself and Iori, the three investigated suspicious
            activity that in some way related to Orochi. After defeating Mukai and revealing the existence of Those From the Past, the three investigated Orochi's seal - where they were ambushed by Ash, whom stole Chizuru's sacred treasure as well as
            her power. Ash escaped before either of the two could stop him, and Kyo swore to take vengeance for what he had done.</p>
          <p>The next tournament saw Kyo and Iori teamed up once again, with Shingo serving as the third member of the team. However, with all that occured due to both the excursions of Those From The Past and Ash himself, the presence of Orochi was growing
            much stronger - so strong, in fact, that it caused Iori to go beserk and attack his own teammates. After Iori had severely injured both Kyo and Shingo, Ash appeared once more and stole Iori's sacred treasure as well, promising that Kyo would
            be next before departing.</p>
          <p>Hospitalized from the ordeal, Kyo chose not to wait for his body to recover and left, wandering the city in the meantime. Not too long after, he was approached by two mysterious figures, whom tried to fight him - however, after making a show
            with his flames, he instead received yet another invitation to the tournament, no doubt where Ash would be waiting for him. Around the same time, he found out the existence of several of his clones left over from the NESTS cartel - with his
            hands full, Kyo decided to tackle all of his problems at once and rid himself of these annoyances for good.</p>

        <img src="img/school.jpg" alt="">
        <strong>Highschool Throwback</strong>
        <p>Kyo was pretty lucky to go to a school where the dress code was relatively loose by Japanese standards. While he was confined to a standard school shirt and pants, there was no rule on designs or accessories - as a result, he typically wore a
          white headband and gold-trimmed black gloves with his clan's symbol on the back of those job on top of his normal school attire. He also wears plain white school shoes that are just on the cusps of being sneakers. His outer shirt also sports
          the Kusanagi symbol on the back. Beneath that he wears a plain white shirt tucked into his pants, which are held up with a light-colored leather belt.</p>
        <p>While he's long since outgrown wearing this in his day-to-day (read: his mother finally stopped pestering him about school considering all the shit that happened since the NESTS cartel), he does occasionally wear it in low-risk organized fights
          and tournaments for old time's sake - especially when he's with his normal crew. Somehow, the feeling of being in his old clothes while pulling off new tricks is immensely gratifying...</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tile">
        <img src="img/nests.jpg" alt="">
        <strong>NESTS Millenial</strong>
        <p>One of two outfits he often wears: this one in particular he wears when he doesn't want a constant reminder of his clan duties, as it doesn't have a trace of his clan symbol anywhere. Originally this was just clothing he had obtained after fighting his way out of the NESTS cloning facility, and it just happened to adopt an overall look that he classifies as 'dope'. An untucked black shirt covering the belt with a white-outlined cross on the front, a white jacket with some extra pocket space and black strips outlining where those pockets are, and grey-blue jeans with a chain hanging on the left side of the waistband. On his hands and wrists respectively are fingerless gloves with the backs exposed and dark brown casual shoes.</p>
        <p>He actively hunts down the stray Kyo clones whenever he hears word of them from K' and his surrogate family, and wears this when he does so. Just as a reminder to whoever from NESTS might still be monitoring them.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tile">
        <img src="img/max.jpg" alt="">
        <strong>Maximum Impact</strong>
        <p>A biker outfit that he wears during the night to make himself more visible; nothing worse than crashing headlong into a car or some other unfortunate pedestrian and having to deal with that mess. The white of his jacket is more reflective so headlights can shine on him better and render him a proper beacon to avoid - in the same vein, this means that the jacket's flexibility is very poor. As a result the shoulders and breasts of the jacket are made of a flexible waterproof material; the heavier reflective material of the rest of the jacket is kept where it is with white-trimmed red shoulder straps like a classic motorcycle jacket.</p>
        <p>Underneath it he wears a zipped-up black and white vest because the jacket itself is hot enough as it is. On his lower body he wears black jeans that are slightly tattered at the ends with a white belt keeping it up, white shoes with black soles, and similarly-colored gloves on his hands. He wears a chain on the right side of his pants as well, strapped on by loops around the first two waist straps.</p>
        <p>He only ever wears this during the night, as it's annoying even for him when it's reflecting the sun's rays. It also doesn't have his clan symbol on the back; there's no way to properly display it, so he opted not to bother spending money on that useless design.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tile">
        <img src="img/neo.jpg" alt="">
        <strong>Neo Kusanagi</strong>
        <p>He doesn't wear his school outfit outside of special occasions anymore, but there's always an appeal to simple black, blue and white or anything close to it - not to mention that in spite of needing breaks from reminders about his clan duties, he is still immensely proud of his heritage and takes his duties very seriously. As a result he wears a more loose white shirt tucked into dark blue jeans held up by an especially long leather belt that hangs off towards the left leg. Yet again he has a chain hanging from the right side of his pants, though it's a faux gold in color as opposed to the normal silver.</p>
        <p>He wears the same shoes as he does in his NESTS-era attire, and his old gloves from his school days. Adorning it all is a dark leather jacket with his clan's sigil on the back and additional pocket space for little things like his wallet and keys. The inside of the jacket is incredibly breathable since he is ultimately a pyrokinetic - since evolved into a thermokinetic.</p>
        <p>He alternates between this and his NESTS outfit, but more often than not opts for this one.</p>

          <strong>Kusanagi-ryu Kobujutsu: Kyo Acoustic Cover</strong>
          <p>The Kusanagi style of ancient martial arts is the main fighting style of the Kusanagi family. Originally, due to their family's treasure, it had weapon-based origins but it was adapted over the years to focus on utilizing the user's fists for their pyrokinesis abilities. It remains a legacy amongst the family's members and is traditionally handed down with each passing generation. The exception to this is Shingo, who was taught albeit jokingly by Kyo, and then later by Saisyu.</p>
          <p>The style was shared by their family's friend, the Yagami (formerly Yasakani) clan. However, after the Yasakani subjected themselves to Orochi's blood, their styles began to deviate from one another. This martial art is very much like traditional Japanese karate style by adding Chinese kung fu in it. Kyo put his own spin on the style by incorporating Kenpo in The King of Fighters '96 onwards.</p>
          <p>Its been insinuated, particularly in The King of Fighters: Kyo that the Kusanagi style harbors a dark side that potentially transforms the practitioner into a mindless berserker, not very different from the Riot of the Blood and Street Fighter's Satsui no Hado. Careless practitioners of the Kusanagi bloodline may end up falling to this path if they lose themselves to its darker side. This happens to Kyo in the 1998 drama CD and The King of Fighters: Kyo manga and echoes with his clones in the Hong Kong comics. Souji in the KOF Kyo story is particularly wary about it that he stopped training lest he becomes one himself completely.</p>
